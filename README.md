# ESPNet: Edge-Aware Graph Representation Learning over Analyst‚ÄìFirm Bipartite Networks for Earnings Surprise Prediction
This repository provides the official implementation of our ICDM 2025 submission: ESPNet.  
ESPNet is a GINE-based graph neural network framework designed to predict earnings surprises by modeling analyst‚Äìfirm interactions as a heterogeneous bipartite graph. The framework integrates edge-aware message passing and relational feature propagation to capture complex financial signals for robust prediction and downstream portfolio analysis.

## üß† Key Features

- Graph-based representation of firm‚Äìanalyst networks
- Edge-aware message passing using GINE
- Two-stage earnings surprise classification tasks:
  - High vs. low ESP magnitude
  - Positive vs. negative directional surprise
- Long‚Äìshort portfolio construction based on predicted signals
- Robust performance across evaluation metrics
